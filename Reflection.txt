2. No, my bot will not win every possible game of SimpleNim. This is because FINISH. For example, if there are 5 pieces left and it is your turn, taking any number of pieces (1, 2, or 3) would result in a state where your opponent would be able to win no matter what. The minimax algorithm finds the best score for both players, and since bestMove considers the next state (which is when it is the other player's turn), there will be times when the bot is unable to produce the best result for you. The algorithm still produces the best strategy for the other player and allows them to win, but you will probably be sad that you didn't win.

3. If the goal of Nim became taking the last piece, the strategy would more or less flip. First off, in lines LINE NUMBERS, the base case would need to be changed so that if there were 0 pieces left and it was your turn, -1 would be returned because that situation means you lost. In terms of scoring, player X could still maximize and player Y could still minimize, so the algorithm for calculating the scores could remain the same. In bestMove, you would still want to use similar logic by checking if the next state is favorable for a player. Now that the base case in minimax would be different, bestMove would take that into account when calling the function, and calls that were favorable for player X in Nim will be unfavorable in AntiNim.
